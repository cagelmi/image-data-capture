# --- Project Specific Output ---
# Avoid committing data files generated by running the application
# Note: User chooses save location, so these might not be in the project dir.
# Consider adding specific patterns if you always save outputs locally, e.g.:
# extracted_data_*.txt
# extracted_data_*.xlsx

# --- Sensitive Information ---
# If you ever add config files with secrets, add them here
# e.g., config.ini, .env
